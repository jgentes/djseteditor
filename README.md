# DJ Set Editor (for lack of a better name)

For some reason, there are two types of products on the market for DJ's to use for mixing music:

1. DJ apps (VirtualDJ, etc) - these all replicate the 2 turntable scenario, which is great for mixing 2 tracks together. The goal is 'real time' DJing based on the strategy of recording an entire set perfectly the first time, or start over and try again.

2. DAW apps (Audacity, Cubase, etc) - these assume you're making music, with lots of sampling and effects, optimized for audio production. It supports laying out multiple tracks (which is what is missing in DJ apps) but doesn't provide the basic context that DJ's need, such as BPM detection, beatmatching, and simple crossfading between tracks. Of course these things can be done with these tools, but it's not easy and certainly not what they are designed for.

The goal of this app is to provide a focused user experience that delivers on the need to lay out a series of tracks, easily tweak the transition from one track to the next, and save the output as a finished set. Perhaps it will evolve to automatically suggest transition timing and effects based on the sound dynamics of the music, however that's not the initial goal.

Thanks go to [**Tomasz Owczarczyk**](https://github.com/0wczar) for the wonderfully minimal Airframe UI theme repackaged with MIT license.

Thanks also the great [**BBC**](https://github.com/bbc) who created the [peaks.js](https://github.com/bbc/peaks.js) library for waveform analysis and navigation.

It is because of these, and many other dependent, openly sourced and freely labored efforts that I humbly give back to the community that has given so much to me.
